### Description of the assignment.

A web application has been designed to display infinite images from Unsplash API(Developer Documentation) using AXIOS Library. 
In the respective web application , I have designed to load infinite images from a particular collection automatically by scrolling down (infinite scrolling). In the web application page I have designed 4 tabs to represent four different collection of images.
As the page gets loaded  , the initially loaded images gets grouped together while rendering the page and other tabs displays the images related to a specific topic of what was clicked.
